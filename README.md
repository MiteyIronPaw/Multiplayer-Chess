Multiple player chess
=============
This is a chess game that lets you play with literally any number of players (Expect negatives, 0 and fractions). It's dependant on your computer speed and the resuoltion/size of your screen so Infinity players also propably wont work. The game is written almost entirely in JavaScript except the Inital page which passes the number of players to the game via PHP.

If you don't have a PHP server it's relatively easy to set the number of players manually by:

1.  Renaming "./Game/index.php" to "./Game/index.html"
2.  Changing JavaScript Players variable to what ever number

I made this as a school project and wanted to share it but because I have nothing to host it on I decided to share to the code. Feel free to use it how you like.

P.S. 1 player is not very fun.
